Open Source Project, Github Jun 2022 

Project Name: Blogify

 I built a simple utility plugin meant to aid in the eleventy build process. This plugin is built on top of Unifiedjs which is a compiler frontend for structured data written in JavaScript. My utility points at a source directory containing Markdown files and transforms those .md files to a JSON array with the content field of each object being a HTML representation of the original markdown files contents.
